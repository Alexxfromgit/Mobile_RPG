**Key game features**

    • Base building (military themed)
    • Tactical operations (PVE, PVP)

**Backpack overview:**

    1. The Backpack is used for collecting and storing items that are generated during
       tactical operations
    2. The Backpack can store the following items:
        • Equipment (helmets, boots etc.)
        • Medication and boosts
    3. Items in enemy backpacks will fall out when the enemy is killed. This may be one
       or more items. Any items generated in this way are collected by the player.
    4. As soon as they are generated, all items are stored automatically in the player’s Backpack.
    5. The player is able to move any collected items from their Backpack into the
       main storage after returning to the military base.
       
**Unlocking the Backpack**

    • Players of all levels will have access to the Backpack, starting from
      their very first session
    • The Backpack will have a limited number of slots
    • All slots start empty
    • The player can collect items from tactical operations to fill the Backpack slots
    • The player can also move items from their main storage to the Backpack.
    • However, only medication and boosts can be sent to the Backpack from the main storage.
    • Each slot can contain one or more items;
    • The total quantity of slots depends on the level of soldier that the player used
      in their tactical operation.
    • Players can buy additional slots using in-game currency.

**Backpack rules**

    1. Once all slots in the Backpack are full, the player cannot collect any other
       items from a tactical operation:
        • However, the player can enter their Backpack and remove (drop) collected items
          during the tactical operation.
        • The player can re-collect items they have dropped at any time during a tactical operation;
    2. During the tactical operation, only medication and boosts can be used directly from the Backpack:
        • Items cannot be used or equipped during the tactical operation.
    3. The player can drop any collected item from their Backpack during a tactical operation.
